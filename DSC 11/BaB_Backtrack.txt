BRANCH AND BOUND / BACKTRACKING

state space tree
both are optimization problems
both the strategies always give the most optimal answer if it exists

Tree Pruning - we set a condition, bound, 

Total permutations of a binary tree - Catalogue Number
[(2n)C(n)]/(n+1)

BaB - we set upper and lower bound (set boundries)
    - in general, BFS traversal (Breadth First Search)
    - minimization

Criteria to stop for BaB - when a constraint is violated
                         - we set a bound, this bound will tell us the max value

Backtracking - strictly DFS traversal (Depth First Search)
             - 0/1 Knapsack can be solved by Backtracking

Q. Given a srt of objects xi, with their respective weights Wi and profits Pi.
   Max weight carrying capapcity - W/C.

Solu. 
i.   calculate Pi/Wi ratio
ii.  sort the objects in descending order of Pi/Wi ratio
iii. at the root node, set P and W as 0
iv.  set upper bound as B = P + (C-Wi).[(Pi+1)/(Wi+1)]


Q1. 0/1 Knapsack problem using BaB
xi = [1 2 3 4]
Pi = [40 42 25 12]
Wi = [4 7 5 3]
Pi/Wi = [10 6 5 4]
C = 10

TYPES OF BaB
    LIFO - stack based
    FIFO - queue based
    LC - least cost

LIFO BaB (stack)
Jobs = {J1, J2, J3, J4, J5, .......Jn}
//Push and Pop
//while expandin node, push expansions to the stack and then continue popping stack

FIFO BaB (queue)
Jobs = {J1, J2, J3, J4}
//we use Breadth First Search

Example:-
Jobs      - 1 2  3 4
Profits   - 5 10 6 3
Deadlines - 1 3  2 1
Timetaken - 1 2  1 1
//we have to calculate Cost and Upper Bound

cost = sum of given profits/penalties till the jod in consideration
upperBound = sum of all given profits/penalties except the one which are included in the solution

Pruning Criteria - at any node if cost > current global UB, we can kill/prune it
                 - if the time and deadline criteria of considering multiple jobs
                   does not satisfy, DO NOT expand further

Example:-
Jobs      - 1  2  3  4 
Profits   - 10 20 15 25
Deadlines - 2  3  2  4
Timetaken - 1  2  2  3
