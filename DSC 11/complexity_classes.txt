COMPLEXITY CLASSES
- P
- NP
- NP Complete
- Co-NP
- NP Hard
- NP Easy


P Class
- if a problem is verifiable and solvable in polynomial time, it is a P Class problem
- Multiplication, Sorting, Searching problems


NP Class
- if a problem is verifiable and not solvable in polynomial time, it is a NP Class problem
- TSP


NP Hard
- if a problem is solvable in more than polynomial time, it is a NP Hard problem


NP Easy
- if a problem is solvable in lesser time than polynomial time, it is a NP Easy problem


NP Complete
- consists of those problems which are either unsolvable or time requred to solve is very large compared to polynomial time


Co-NP
- if problem and its complement are in NP Class, it is Co-NP Class
