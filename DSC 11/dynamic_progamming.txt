DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING
- optimal solving problem
- tabulation or memorization
- find all possible solution set and then pick up the best solution set to get the solution set
- recursive approach is used by a recursive solution set is not formed


MEMORIZATION
A[n] = -1   |
A[0] = 0    |O(1)
A[1] = 1    |

for (i=1;i<n;i++){          |
    A[i] = A[i-1] + A[i-2]  | O(n)
}                           |
return A;   |O(1)

T(n) = n + c
T(n) = O(n)
