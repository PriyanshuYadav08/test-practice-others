TRAVELLING SALESMAN PROBLEM

let V set of all vertices,
    S a subset of vertices

    D[Vi][S] is length of the shortest path from Vi to Vj (origin, phi, V1) via S
    this is exactly once

    [] -> distance, {} -> set/vertex, S = {V3}

    D[V2][S] = length [V2, V3, V1]
    
    S = {V2, V3}
    D[V1][S] = length [V1, V2, V3, Vj]

D[Vi][S] = min(j, Vj belong to S) (W[i][j] + D[Vj][S-{Vj}])
D[Vj][phi] = w[i][phi]
