RELATIONAL ALGEBRA

UNARY RELATIONAL OPERATIONS
    Select - (sigma)
    Project - (pi)
    Rename - (phi)

SELECT
- Select operation is used to select a subset of the tuples from a relation based on a selection condition
- selection condition acts as a filter
- keeps only thoe tuples that satisfy the qualifying condition
- tuples satisfying the condition are selected whereas the other tuples are discarded (filtered out) 

PROJECT
- denoted by (pi)
- keeps certain columns (attributes) from a relation and discards the other columns
- creates a vertical partioning
    - the list of specified columns is kept in each tuple
- duplicate tupls are discarded
- the numbers of tuples in the reslut of projection is always less or equal to the number of tuples in R
- PROJECT is not commutative

QUESTION
