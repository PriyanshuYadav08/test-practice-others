DSC 15 SOFTWARE ENGINEERING NOTES

- Software Engineering is the art and science of planning and leading software projects.
- It is a sub-discipline of project management in which software projects are planned, implemented, monitored, and controlled.

1. What is the difference between Project, Process, and Software?

Project:
    - A temporary endeavor with a specific goal, timeline, and resources to deliver a unique product or result (e.g., developing a new software application).
    - A project should have a deadline (start and end date).
    - Well-defined task with a starting and ending point; ends when its goal is achieved, hence it is a temporary phase in the lifetime of an organization.
    - It has a unique and distinct goal and is not a routine activity or day-to-day operation.
    - Needs adequate resources in terms of time, manpower, finance, material, and knowledge bank.

Process:
    - A set of structured activities or steps followed to achieve a task, often used to manage and control software development (e.g., Agile, Waterfall).

Software:
    - The final product or set of programs and related data that perform specific tasks for users or systems.

2. It is an essential part of software engineering to deliver a quality product, keeping the cost within the client's budget constraints and delivering the project as per schedule.
    - SE is essential to incorporate user requirements along with budget and time constraints.

3. Software Project Manager
    - A person who undertakes the responsibility of executing the project; he/she is thoroughly aware of all the phases of SDLC.
    - May never directly be involved in producing the end product but controls and manages the activities involved in production.
    - Closely monitors the development process, prepares and executes various plans, arranges necessary and adequate resources, time, quality, and customer satisfaction.
    - Responsibilities of Project Manager:
        - Managing people:
            - Acts as project leader
            - Liaison with stakeholders
            - Managing human resources
            - Setting up reporting hierarchy
        - Managing project:
            - Defining and setting up project scope
            - Managing project management activities
            - Monitoring progress and performance
            - Risk analysis at every phase
            - Take necessary steps to avoid or resolve problems
            - Act as project spokesperson

4. Project Planning
    - This task is performed before the production of software actually starts.
    - No concrete activity.
    - Set of multiple processes.

5. Scope Management
    - Creates a boundary of the project by clearly defining what would be done and what would not be done in the project.
    - Project contains limited and quantifiable tasks which can easily avoid cost and time overrun.
    - It includes:
        - Defining the scope
        - Deciding its verification and control
        - Dividing the project into various smaller parts for ease of management

6. Project Estimation
    - Decomposition: Lines of code, Function points
    - Empirical Estimation: Putnam model, COCOMO

7. Project Scheduling
    - Break down the project tasks into smaller, manageable forms
    - Find out various tasks and correlate them
    - Estimate time frame required for each task
    - Divide them into work units
    - Assign adequate number of work units for each task
    - Calculate total time required for the project from start to finish

8. Resource Management
    - Creation of a project team and allocating responsibilities to each team member
    - Determining resources required at a particular stage and their availability
    - Manage resources by generating resource requests when they are required and de-allocating them when they are no longer needed

9. Project Risk Management
    - experienced staff leaving the project and new staff coming
    - change in organizational management
    - requirement change or misinterpreting requirement
    - under-estimation of required time and resources
    - technological changes, environmental changes and business competition
    - Processes - Identification, Categorize, Manage, Monitor

10. Project Communication Management
    - Planning, Sharing, Feedback, Closure

11. Configuration Management
    - it tracks and controls the changes in software in terms of requirements, design, functions and development of the product
    - baseline - measurement that define completeness of a phase

12. Change Control
    - Identification, Validation, Analysis, Control, Execution, Close request

13. Project Management Tools
    - Gantt chart - timeline chart
    - Pert chart - network diagram
    - Resources histogram - staff planning and coordination
    - Critical path analysis - interdependent tasks

14. System Requirement Statement (SRS)
    - Problem Statement
    - Scope Document
    - Functional Requirements
    - Non-functional Requirements
    - Interface Requirements
    - Performance Requirements
    - Design Constraints (constrain on a particular feature; not in the design phase)
    - Functional and non-functional attributes
    - Prelim Schedule and Budget
    - Customer Feedback

15. Project Management Maturity (Dr. Kerzner's 16 points)
    - adopt a project management methodology and use it consistently
    - implement a philosophy that drives the company towards project management maturity and communicate it to everyone
    - commit to developing effective plans at the beginning of each project
    - minimise the cope changes by commiting to realistic objectives
    - recognize that cost and scheduled management are inseparable
    - select the right person as the project manager
    - provide executive with project sponser information, not project management information
    - strengthen involvement and supportof line management
    - focus on deliverables rather than resources
    - clutivate effective Communication, cooperation and trust to achieve rapid project management maturity
    - share recognition for project success with the entire project team and line management
    - eliminate nonproductive meetings
    - focus on idenitying and solving poroblems early, quickly and cost effectively
    - measure progress periodically
    - use project management software as a tool - not a subsitute of effective planning
    - institute an all-employe training program with periodic updates based upon document lessons learned

16. Product v/s Project management

17. Maturity and Excellence in Project
    - Maturite in project management is the implement of a standard methodology and accompanying processes such that there exits a high likelihood of reputed successes
    - Orgss excellent in project management are those that create the environment in which there exists a continuous steam of successfully managed project and where success is measured by what is in the best interest of both the company and the project (the customer)

18. Software Metric
    - its a quantitative measure of an attribute a software system posses with respect to cost, quality, size and schedule
    - measure - no of errors
    - metrics - no of errors found per person

19. Cyclometric Complexity
    - software metric used to measure the complexity of a program
    - measure independent paths through program source code
    - independent path is defined as the path that has at least one ddge which has not been transversed before in any other paths.
    - can be calculated with respect to functions, modules, methods or classes within a program
    - Nodes represent task, lines represent path
    - Complexity = V(G) = E - N + 2
        - E - number of edges
        - N - number of nodes
    - V(G) = P + I
        - P - number of predicate nodes

20. Use of Cyclometric Complexity
    - determining the independent path executions thus proven to be very helpful for develops and testers
    - it can make sure that every path has been tested at least once
    - thus help to focus more on uncovered paths
    - code coverage can be improved
    - risks associated with the program can be evaluated
    - these metrics being used earlier in the program help in reducing the risks

21. Advantages of Cyclometric Complexity
    - quality metric, given the relative complexity of various design
    - it is used to measure the minimum efforts and best areas of concentration for testing
    - it is able to guide the testing process
    - it is easy to apply

22. Disadvantages of Cyclometric Complexity
    - measure the program's control complexity and not the data complexity
    - nested conditions structure are harder to understand then non neste structure
    - in the case of simple comparisons and decision structures, it may givec a misleading figure

23. Test Case
    - smallest unit of the testing plan
    - includes a description of necessary actions and parameters to achieve and verify the expected behaviour of a particular function or the part of the tested software
    - scenarios - user logged in, upload photos, upload button, select photos, upload them, etc

24. Deployment/Maintenance Phase
    - Escalation - given warning is ignored
    - It is a negative sign for any employee
    - Memo
        - Logo, Company Name
        - Project ID and Name
        - To (cc)
        - From
        - Subject
        - Body
    - Firing
